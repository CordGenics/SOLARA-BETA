## Q&A

**Why do I need to disable AV (Antivirus)**

Windows Defender falsely flags our software due to its functionality. This is common in virtually every single executor existing and defunct such as Krnl,Oxygen U, Kiwi X and much more. All Roblox executors need to inject within the roblox process to hide detection by Roblox anticheat (Byfron). This isn't a 'defect' isolated to Solara. Every single executor existing and defucnt require you to disable AV due to the aforementioned reason. This improper flagging is commonly known as a [False Positive]([url](https://support.avira.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002183358-What-is-a-false-positive-Avira-Antivirus-detection))

> False positives (false alarms) are harmless files or URLs that are incorrectly identified as malicious by the antivirus program. Software programs that behave like malware or use identical file compression and protection techniques are susceptible to false alarms.

**is Solara safe?** 

Solara is completely free and open source (**FOSS**) meaning that its source code is **publicablly availble** to read and edit making viruses **IMPOSSIBLE** to obfuscate. It is also the longest continously working exploits since 2023. Relative to other executors, Solara is the only existing executor that is FOSS.
